In this project I'm gonna apply my knoledge that I learn about DOM manipulation.

This project is a Etch a Sketch game, with three buttons.
delete -- delete all grid 
scale -- add a grid scale lessthan 100x100
clear -- turn the content inside into white, as a default.

The principle study target is adding elements and unchain events. My main dificult was to deal with create the elements and organizing them into equals squares. I tackled this challenge with grid propertie from css.
